      <h3 style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Early Life</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Born on 1 September 1896, the day after Janmastami(the birth date of lord krishna), one of the most important festivals, in a humble house in Calcutta to a Bengali Kayastha family,[21] he was named Abhay Charan, "one who is fearless,
            having
            taken shelter at Lord Krishna's feet." Since he was born on the day of Nandotsava ("the celebration of Nanda," Krishna's father, a traditional festival in honour of Krishna's birth) he was also called Nandulāl. His parents, "Sriman" Gour
            Mohan
            De and "Srimati" Rajani De, were devout Vaishnavas (devotees of Vishnu). In accordance with Bengali tradition, his mother had gone to the home of her parents for the birth, and only a few days later Abhay returned with parents to his home
            at 6
            Sitakanta Banerjee Lane, Kolkata.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <p>He received a European-style education at the Scottish Church College, which was well regarded among Bengalis; many Vaishnava families sent their sons there. The professors, most of whom were Europeans, were known as sober, moral
            men.[23]
            The
            college was located in north Calcutta, near the De's family home on Harrison Road. In the college, Abhay Charan De (অভয়চরণ দে) was a member of the English Society as well as that of the Sanskrit Society, and it has been suggested that
            his
            education provided him with a foundation for his future leadership.[8][22] He graduated in 1920 with majors in English, philosophy and economics.[24] He rejected his diploma in response to Gandhi's independence movement.[25] When he was
            22
            years old, he married Radharani Devi, who was then 11 years old, in a marriage arranged by their parents. At 14, she gave birth to their first son.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Reasons for leaving home</h3>
      <p>Once Srila Prabhupad had gone to preach about Vaishnavism and Lord Krishna, his wife sold his manuscript to a book seller in exchange of tea, after then conversation with his wife she said in anger said that she preferred tea over
        him.[27][28][29] Srila Prabhupada tried his hard to convince his wife to help him in his mission throughout his household life till 1950, but his wife was not interested. Srila Prabhuphada was eager and anxious to fulfill his Spiritual
        master's
        instructions and order of giving this wonderful gift of godconsciousness, Krishnaconsciousness to humanity so that all souls of the world could get relief out of pains and suffering. So one day he decided to renunciate the household and
        dedicated his life for humanity.</p>

      <h3 style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Religious journey</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>n 1922, when he first met his spiritual master, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, he was requested to spread the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the English language.[30] In 1933 he became a formally initiated disciple of
            Bhaktisiddhānta.
            In 1944, (from his front room at Sita Kanta Banerjee, Calcutta), he started the publication called Back to Godhead,[31][32] for which he was writer, designer, publisher, editor, copy editor and distributor. He personally designed the
            logo,
            an
            effulgent figure of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the upper left corner, with the motto: "Godhead is Light, Nescience is darkness" greeting the readers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>n 1947, the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society recognised his scholarship with the title Bhaktivedanta, (bhakti-vedānta) meaning "one who has realised that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the end of all knowledge"[34] (with the words
            Bhakti,indicating devotion and Vedanta indicating conclusive knowledge).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>His later well known name, Prabhupāda, is a Sanskrit title, literally meaning "he who has taken the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord" where prabhu denotes "Lord", and pāda means "taking shelter."[36] Also, "at whose feet masters
            sit".[8]
            This name was used as a respectful form of address by his disciples from late 1967/early 1968 onwards. Previous to this, as with his early disciples, followers had called him "Swamiji".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>From 1950 onwards, he lived at the medieval Radha-Damodar mandir in the holy town of Vrindavan, where he began his commentary and translation work of the Sanskrit work Bhagavata Purana.[38] Of all the notable temples in Vrindavana, the
            Radha-Damodar mandir had at the time the largest collection of copies of the original writings of the Six Gosvamis and their followers – more than two thousand separate manuscripts, many of them 300 to 400 years old.[39][40] His guru,
            Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, had always encouraged him to print books, and beholding his spiritual master, Abhay felt the words deeply enter his own life – "If you ever get money, print books."[41] referring to the need for the
            literary
            presentation of the Vaishnava culture.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Renunciation</h3>
      <p>The Gaudiya Matha at Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh was where he lived, wrote and studied, edited the Gauḍīya Patrikā magazine and where he donated the deity of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu which stands on the altar beside those of Radha Krishna (named
        Śrī
        Śrī Rādhā Vinodavihārījī). During his visit in September 1959 he entered the doors of this matha dressed in white, as Abhoy Babu, but he left dressed in saffron, as a Vaishnava renunciate (sannyasi).[10] He took his renunciate vows from his
        friend and godbrother Bhakti Prajnana Keshava. On becoming a sannyasa he also took the prenominal Swami (स्वामी Svāmī). He single-handedly published the seventeen chapter first book of Bhagavata Purana, filling three volumes of four hundred
        pages each, enriched with a detailed commentary. The introduction to the first volume was a biographical sketch of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.[40] He then left India, obtaining free passage on a Scindia Line freighter named Jaladuta, with the aim
        and
        hope of fulfilling his spiritual master's instruction to spread the message of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu around the world. In his possession were a suitcase, an umbrella, a supply of dry cereal, about eight dollars worth of Indian currency, and
        several boxes of books.</p>

      <h2>Books and Publishing</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Bhaktivedanta Swami's books are considered one of the most significant contributions.[61][62] During the final twelve years of his life, Bhaktivedanta Swami translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures (e.g. Bhagavad Gita,
            Chaitanya Charitamrita and Srimad Bhagavatam) into the English language.[63] For their authority, depth and clarity, his books have won praise from professors at colleges and universities like Harvard, Oxford, Cornell, Columbia, Syracuse,
            Oberlin, and Edinburgh.[64] His Bhagavad-gītā As It Is was published by Macmillan Publishers in 1968 with an unabridged edition in 1972.[65][66][67] It is now available in over sixty languages around the world with some of his other books
            available in over eighty different languages.[31][51] In February 2014, ISKCON's news agency reported reaching a milestone of distributing over half a billion books authored by Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada since 1965.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust was established in 1972 to publish his works, and it has also published his multi-volume biography, Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta, that according to Larry Shinn, will "certainly be one of the most complete
            records
            of
            the life and work of any modern religious figure".[2][68] Prabhupada reminded his devotees before his death that he would live forever in his books, and through them would remain present as a spiritual master (guru).[69] Bhaktivedanta
            Swami
            had
            instilled in his followers an understanding of the importance of writing and publishing not only with regard to his works, but also their own initiatives. His early disciples felt Prabhupada had given them Back To Godhead for their own
            writings
            from the very start.</p>
